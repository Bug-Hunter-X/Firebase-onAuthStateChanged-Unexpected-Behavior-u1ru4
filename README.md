# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` method and provides a solution.

## Problem

The original code incorrectly handles the `onAuthStateChanged` listener, leading to unexpected behavior.  Specifically, it doesn't properly manage the asynchronous nature of authentication and might cause issues with data fetching or UI updates.

## Solution

The solution incorporates best practices for handling asynchronous operations and ensures that the application correctly responds to changes in user authentication status.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using npm install.
3. Run the application.
4. Observe the unexpected behavior.
5. Switch to the `bugSolution.js` file to see the corrected implementation.
